# Destroy all software notes
Notes on the Destroy All Software series

## Season 5

### Python vs. Ruby
#### Philosophy
 * Python: everything is an attribute.
 * Ruby: everything is a method call. 

#### Vision
  * Ruby is focusing on messages between objects, rather than data
  * Python is optimising for data access

**Question** 
Is Ruby more "object oriented" due to this fact?
